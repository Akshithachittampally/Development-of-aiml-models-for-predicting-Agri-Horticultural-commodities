To pridict the prices of Agricultural commodities. A main focus on pulses 

 Introduction

1. Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy.
2. A large portion of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood.
3. Among the various agricultural products, pulses and vegetables play a vital role in nutrition and income.
4. Price fluctuations in these commodities affect both farmers and consumers.
5. Accurate price forecasting helps stakeholders make informed decisions.

 Motivation

6. Pulses and vegetables are perishable in nature.
7. Their prices vary due to seasonal, climatic, and market factors.
8. Farmers often face losses due to the lack of proper price prediction systems.
9. AI/ML can provide predictive insights using historical and real-time data.
10. This motivates the development of AIML-based predictive models for agri-horticultural commodities.

 Objective

11. To develop AI and ML models to predict the prices of pulses and vegetables.
12. To analyze patterns and trends in historical market data.
13. To provide decision-support tools for farmers, traders, and policymakers.
